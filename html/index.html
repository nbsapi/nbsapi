            <h2>What is NBSAPI?</h2>
            <p>NBSAPI is an open API designed to enable interoperability among tools that facilitate nature-based solutions (NbS) for the built and natural environments. By standardizing data sharing mechanisms, NBSAPI helps developers and technology providers who are building applications to address environmental challenges such as:
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Flood mitigation</li>
                    <li>Drought resilience</li>
                    <li>Urban heat reduction</li>
                    <li>Groundwater management</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            With NBSAPI, tool developers can exchange data with other services and applications, fostering collaboration and innovation in environmental and urban resilience projects.</p>
